## Title
The new NSCollectionView (10.11+) does not re-tile correctly after resizing

## Description
`NSCollectionView` with a custom horizontal layout does not re-tile correctly after its height is altered.

## Steps to reproduce
0. Download the sample code
1. Open the HorizontalCollectionViewIssue Xcode project
2. Build and run
3. The window with a horizontal collection view of 42 cards appears
4. Shrink the window to a half of its initial height

## Expected Results
Collection view resizes the visible cells and tiles the vacated space with more cells.

## Actual Results
The visible cells are resized, but no cells are being added to the vacated space. Sometimes you can trigger tiling with a scrolling, sometimes the collection view may stay nearly empty until you continue to resize it further.

## Versions
macOS Version 10.12.1 (16B2657)
Xcode Version 8.1 (8B62)

## Additional Notes
I've made a screencast that demonstrates the issue, see "HorizontalCollectionViewIssue.mov".
