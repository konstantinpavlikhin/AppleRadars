## Title
SecTransformExecute leaks memory

## Description
When you use a SecTransformExecute to run a hash transform (kSecDigestSHA1, kSecDigestMD5 and so on...) your app leaks memory.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Open an attached sample project
2. Build and run
3. Program calculates a SHA1 digest of the same data 100000 times

## Expected Results
Digests are calculated, memory consumption is hardly noticeable.

## Actual Results
Digests are calculated, but multiple gigabytes of RAM are 'eaten'.

## Configuration
The same code built with a 10.9 SDK does not leak.

## Xcode Version/Build & OS X Version/Build
Xcode 7.1 (7B91b)
OS X 10.11.2 (15C27e)
