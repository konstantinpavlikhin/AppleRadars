## Title
Source list NSOutlineView doesn't respect a row height returned by its delegate

## Description
I have source list NSOutlineView that is configured to have rows of variable height. I've implemented an -outlineView:heightOfRowByItem: delegate method to return appropriate values for each item. When outline view is first loaded the actual height of a group row is lower than expected by 2 points. When a new group row is inserted above the existing one the row gets shrunk even more.

##  Steps to reproduce
1. Open the attached OutlineViewRowHeightIssue.xcodeproj
2. Build and Run
3. The "OutlineViewRowHeightIssue" window appears
4. Look at the sole source list entry, its actual height is 22 points (outline view's delegate returned 24 for this row!)
5. Hover over the entry so the "Show" button appears, click on it
6. Click on the "Insert section at the beginning" button to insert a new empty section
7. A new section appears at the top of the list
8. Notice the height of the sections: the new one has 22 points, while the old one had shrunk to 18 points

## Expected Results
Both section rows are always n points tall, where n is a value returned by -outlineView:heightOfRowByItem:. (24 points for the sample app).

## Actual Results
Section rows height is being altered. After initial -reloadData the height is lowered by two points, but after insertion of a new section above existing one its height shrinks down by additional 4 points. (18 points for the sample app).

## Configuration

## Xcode Version/Build & OS X Version/Build
Xcode 7.0.1 (7A1001)
OS X 10.11.1 (15B38b)

## Additional Notes

I've made a screencast demonstrating the issue.
